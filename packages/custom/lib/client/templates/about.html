<h1>Tibetalk</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Tibetalk will provide a platform for users to find the most current, popular and discussed content on Tibet.
With a curation team and user submitted content, Tibetalk will connect users to the most important
stories, videos and other media content in a daily snapshot of the web’s most popular content on Tibet.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Provide users around the world with a platform to obtain and share the latest and most popular Tibet-re- lated content in a simple and smart way.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Through the use of innovative platforms, Tibetans – both in diaspora and in Tibet – are more easily able to exchange ideas, collaborate on issues, and build online social networks with Tibetans around the world. A Tibetan in Toronto can now read a blog post about a conservation initiative in Amdo and decide to organize a crowd fund to support this work. Similarly, a Tibetan from Lithang can now view a photo project on the Facebook page of photographer in New York and become inspired to become a photographer herself. These types of interactions are now possible due to the new bridges that these platforms provide.
However, what is currently missing is a single platform where the online Tibetan community can obtain, share and engage with one another, on the latest and most popular content on Tibet in a simple and smart way. The platforms used today to access Tibet-related content are often too exclusive, and not focused and interactive enough. Social media sites, such as Facebook, allow users to receive Tibet-related content, but only from those within our own social networks. They also contain non-Tibet related content, which makes finding information on Tibet more difficult then is needed.
